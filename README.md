# XenForo-Debug-Manager (Enable)
Easily enable debug mode from the admin control panel in only public areas, admin areas, or both. This version is designed for board administrators and developers to quickly enable debug mode for everyone in the admin control panel and/or front-end. It is not recommended to enable debug mode for the front-end as it is known to possibly conflict with some add-ons, primarily those with sandbox payment functionality.
