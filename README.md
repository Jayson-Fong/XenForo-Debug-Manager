# XenForo-Debug-Manager (Full)
Easily enable debug mode from the admin control panel in only public areas, admin areas, or both. This edition also features IP whitelisting and the ability to disable debug mode if the client's IP is not in the whitelist, allowing functionality of both the enable and disable version.

Inspired by https://xenforo.com/community/resources/enable-debug-mode-from-admincp.1356/ and https://xenforo.com/community/resources/th-disable-debug-mode.3150/
