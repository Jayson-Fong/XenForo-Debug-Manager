# XenForo-Debug-Manager (Disable)
Easily disable debug mode from the admin control panel in only public areas, admin areas, or both. Designed for board admins and developers to quickly disable debug mode, primarily if enabled from a board's `library/config.php`.

Inspired by https://xenforo.com/community/resources/enable-debug-mode-from-admincp.1356/ and https://xenforo.com/community/resources/th-disable-debug-mode.3150/
